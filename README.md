# ⚡ PowerTransformer on Concrete Strength 🧱📊

Transforming skewed features for better model performance!

## 🔍 About
This project uses **PowerTransformer** from `sklearn.preprocessing` on the **Concrete Compressive Strength** dataset. The goal is to normalize skewed features and observe the effect on model accuracy.

## 🧰 Steps Covered
- Data loading & EDA  
- Applying `PowerTransformer`  
- Training models (Linear Regression)  
- Comparing results before vs. after transformation  
- Visualizations of feature distributions

## 📊 Dataset Info
- Source: UCI / Kaggle  
- Rows: 1030  
- Target: Concrete Strength (MPa)

## 🚀 Key Result Snapshot Accuracy
| Model            | 1. Before| 2. After |
| Linear Regression| 1. 46   | 2. 80      |

## 💡 Why PowerTransformer?
✅ Handles skewed data  
✅ Improves model stability  
✅ Especially useful for linear models

## 🖼️ Visuals
- Feature distribution before & after transformation  
- Model performance comparison
